CHANGELOG

- Water is now traversable, albeit more slowly than normal terrain. You can swim through it horizontally as well as up and down, but beware of lack of oxygen. This will kill you quickly. Angels and Demons do not need to breathe.

--------------------
Apr 15, 2017 v1.1.0

- Added stealth to the game! Remaining in shadows will render you invisible to your enemies while moving through illuminated terrain (and moving in general) will expose you.  
- To counter stealth, Citizens of the City carry lanterns and Angels radiate light (note that Demons do not have a portable light source). Moreover, stationary light sources were added to the houses and some streets.
- Outdoor lighting depends on the time of day - at midnight you will need to rely on lamps, while at day time the sun will not let anybody hide outside buildings.
- Time of day now changes dynamically as the time passes. 
- Added scenario options regarding the starting time of the day - you may start at night, at noon, in the morning or in the evening.
- Added hearing to the game! Characters' actions will generate sounds that others can hear and learn the general direction to the sound's origin. Most creatures will try to investigate what or who produced the sound if they have no other pressing matters.
- Added the Thief to the game.
- Added Death from Above ability to the Thief. This allows the Thief to jump onto an enemy from an upper Z level and make a devastating blow.
- Added Climbing ability to the Thief. It allows the Thief to go up and down along the Z level when clinging to walls.
- Added trees spanning across several Z levels.
- Added inventories to characters. You are now able to pick up, carry and drop items.

--------------------
Mar 25, 2017 v1.0.9

- The 3rd dimension was added to the map! Buildings now have several floors, mobs can go up and down the slopes.
- Gravity added! You can step off the ledges and fall down. You can drop one Z level without any consequences but any distance greater than that and you will take increasing falling damage.
- Mobs will now recognize the gravity and will short-cut off the ledges if they see they won't take any damage without finding the nearest slope down.
- Added mansions to the building types.
- Removed support of small tiles.

--------------------
Mar 6, 2017 v1.0.8

- Added Gargantaur to the list of monsters. This is a huge outsider beast (occupies 3x3 tiles) that is impervious to most attacks, can attack minds of enemies, as well as heal and teleport itself. While it is classified as an angelic being, do not get it wrong - it will attack anything in sight. Being huge, it has a "face" so unlike smaller beings it will need to really turn around to change the direction of its movement.
- Angels are now able to mount Gargantaurs at the cost of half of their HP. Apart from increasing their defense (the Gargantaur's 3x3 size means that it will take all melee hits first), this gives them an ability to invoke Gargantaur's mind burn.


--------------------
Feb 24, 2017 v1.0.7

- Momentum added! When you have the Momentum ability, that means that you gain speed when moving in a direction and are able to cover several tiles within one turn but you can not drastically change your direction when at high speed (unlike normal movement when you can make all kind of turns and backpedal at any time). If you bump into an obstacle, your speed drops to zero. If you bump into another unit, your speed drops to zero but you will try to push this unit (similar to the Charge ability).
- Horses are added to the game. They are allied with all non-demon factions and have momentum. Horses can be found in the stables.
- Fiends added to the game. They are demonic beasts who will attack everybody (even demons). They also have momentum.
- Horseback riding added! Military units are able to use horses as mounts. When riding a mount, your mount moves independently of your actions, you can only give directions to it. This means that once you've gained speed, the mount will be moving in the chosen direction on its own, while you can shoot the enemies as you pass them by. Mounts may also be used as meatshields as enemies have 50% chance to hit your mount instead of you.
- All demons are able to mount fiends.
- Added scouts to the military. They are armed with rifles, are able to reveal a single enemy and start riding a horse.
- You may now start as a scout. Scouts gain no followers but compensate that with their unsurpassed speed.
- Added stables to the buildings of the city.
