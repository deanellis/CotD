CITY OF THE DAMNED

City of the Damned is a simple fast-paced coffee-break roguelike inspired by a 7DRL entry "City of the Condemned" by Tapio (http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=City_of_the_Condemned). 
It is written in Common Lisp using SDL.

LATEST RELEASE

Apr 25, 2017 v1.1.1

- Water is now traversable, albeit more slowly than normal terrain. You can swim through it horizontally as well as up and down, but beware of the lack of oxygen. This will kill you quickly. Angels and Demons do not need to breathe.
- All Angels, Demons, and humans now have an ability to switch on and off stationary lights if they happen to be near one.
- Added doors to the buildings of the city. All humanoids are able to open and close them.
- Added ability to open/close windows to the Thief.
- You can bump into doors, windows, and lanterns to active the respective ability (if you have one).
- Made Satanists' lair less conspicuous.
