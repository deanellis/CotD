- Eater should get spawn broodlings which are temporary units allied with the player
- Eater should get morph upgrades to armor or weapons
- Satanists should decipher demonic runes from walls to gain power
- Movement on tiles with mobs should cost more so that they do not bump into each other that often

- Move display code to a separate entity (separate thread maybe?) so that you could have some basic movement animation going on (0,5 sec). This will alleviate the performance problem (the game will be still calculating AI while the player movement animation is played) and will generally look good.
- Optimize connectivity map creation
- Recalculate connectivity after terrain destruction
