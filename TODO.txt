- Alarak-style gameplay where you gain resource when allies get killed and you can sacrifice your allies
- Unstable pocket dimensions - complete the goal before the time expires
- Collasping pocket dimensions - complete the goal while the map becomes smaller and smaller
- Machine (using devices), Crimson (bio abilities), Ascendant (hybrid bio-machines)
- A mission for satanists where there are no demons or angels, and they need to kill a certain npc and avoid police
- Chain Lightning attack
- Beam & Sweep arrack
- Make an option to disable some prompts like "disguise as human for angels"
- Flat game map
- Scenario with attacking a battleship
- Add Twosoul character for satanists
- Add Flamethrower operator to the miliatry
- Add courtyard houses like Thief2RL
- Add the Revolutionaries faction
- Add a Thief/Spy campaign
- Move display code to a separate entity (separate thread maybe?) so that you could have some basic movement animation going on (0,5 sec). This will alleviate the performance problem (the game will be still calculating AI while the player movement animation is played) and will generally look good. Make a separate draw loop and a separate game loop
- Optimize connectivity map creation
- Recalculate connectivity after terrain destruction
- Scout's artillery strike ignites appropriate affected tiles
- Better Z level presentation - separate panes with Z nearby levels above/below (ala DF)
