- Avatars of Brilliance should be able to fly
- Present shared mind better: full list of visible units, make units/messages visible through shared mind to be of a different color
- Give Satanists an ability to boost a unit, and maybe make it permanently follow you
- Give Archdemons a ranged attack
- Give consumables to soldiers: Medkit
- Make Thief's smoke bombs a consumable item
- Add wind to the map.
- Add courtyard houses like Thief2RL
- Do something with the message code so that name are captalized (and not capitalized) properly.
- Add highscore table
- Add a Thief/Spy campaign
- Move display code to a separate entity (separate thread maybe?) so that you could have some basic movement animation going on (0,5 sec). This will alleviate the performance problem (the game will be still calculating AI while the player movement animation is played) and will generally look good.
