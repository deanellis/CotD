- Custom win conditions for scenarios
- Demons should have the following win conditions: conquest (place N dimensional rifts), raid (take N corpses to dimensional rift), corrupt (take a holy relic to a rift and then place something instead of it), defend from angels (destroy all angels in a corrupted city), defend from military (destroy all military in a corrupted city), clash (destroy all angels in a non-corrupted city)
- Angels should have the following win conditions: assassinate (get to demon's plane and destroy a powerful demon), cut reinforcements (destroy N dimensional rifts), defend (destroy all attacking demons)
- Military should have the following win conditions: defend from demons (destroy all attacking demons), conquest (destroy N dimensional rifts), raid (take a holy relic from a dimensional plane)
- Add Twosoul character for satanists
- Add Flamethrower operator to the miliatry
- Add courtyard houses like Thief2RL
- Add the Revolutionaries faction
- Add a Thief/Spy campaign
- Move display code to a separate entity (separate thread maybe?) so that you could have some basic movement animation going on (0,5 sec). This will alleviate the performance problem (the game will be still calculating AI while the player movement animation is played) and will generally look good. Make a separate draw loop and a separate game loop
- Optimize connectivity map creation
- Recalculate connectivity after terrain destruction
- Scout's artillery strike ignites appropriate affected tiles.
