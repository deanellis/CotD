- Angels should have one unit, that can temporarily transform itself into an Archangel
- Add smoke as a feature that can reduce visibility. Smoke should move across the map and disperse if its density is too low in a given cell
- Add smoke bombs to the Thief
- Add an ability to lit grass on fire to Angels. Fire should damage those standing in it and produce smoke
- Add courtyard houses like Thief2RL
- Do something with the message code so that name are captalized (and not capitalized) properly.
- Add highscore table
- Add a Thief/Spy campaign
- Move display code to a separate entity (separate thread maybe?) so that you could have some basic movement animation going on (0,5 sec). This will alleviate the performance problem (the game will be still calculating AI while the player movement animation is played) and will generally look good.
