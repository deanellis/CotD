- Add the possessor faction
- Malseraph can turn you into a tree
- Satanists should decipher demonic runes from walls to gain power
- Rune to upgrade a zombie into an imp
- Rune to force a unit back
- Rune to cast a global spell to constantly reanimate corpses
- Movement on tiles with mobs should cost more so that they do not bump into each other that often
- Add courtyard houses like Thief2RL
- Add the Revolutionaries faction
- Add a Thief/Spy campaign
- Move display code to a separate entity (separate thread maybe?) so that you could have some basic movement animation going on (0,5 sec). This will alleviate the performance problem (the game will be still calculating AI while the player movement animation is played) and will generally look good.
- Optimize connectivity map creation
- Recalculate connectivity after terrain destruction
- Player can try targeted abilities to cast them on invisible creatures
