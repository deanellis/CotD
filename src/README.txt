
CITY OF THE DAMNED

--------------------
OVERVIEW

The year is 1915. The Great War thunders in the west, but the Hinterland is not safe either. The Pandemonium Hierarchy invaded the City with the intention to slay its inhabitants. The Celestial Communion had to intervene. Now both sides are bent to fight each other until none of the opponents remain. Choose your side and join the fray!

This is a simple fast-paced coffee-break roguelike inspired by a 7DRL entry "City of the Condemned" by Tapio (http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=City_of_the_Condemned).

GENERAL TIPS

 - The two primary sides are Angels and Demons. Though mankind is allied with the Angels, it is mainly stuck in the conflict between the parties.
 - You are not alone and should not be able to overcome all obstacles by yourself, some enemies will require aid from your allies.
 - Your enemies are able to hide their true appearance, so observe and learn their tactics to avoid nasty surprises.
 - You can attack your allies but not members of your own faction. This does not extend to demons - they can attack anyone.
 - For non-human factions the main resource is power. Each faction has its own way to gain it. You can spend power on your abilities.
 - The objective depends on the mission scenario.

--------------------
THE CELESTIAL COMMUNION

 - You can start as a Chrome Angel who can easily dispatch lowly Imps.
 - Alternatively, you can start a group of Trinity mimics, each having distinct role and abilities.
 - To gain power, bless humans or kill demons.
 
-------------------- 
THE PANDEMONIUM HIERARCHY

 - You start as a puny Crimson or Shadow imp who is no match for a Chrome Angel.
 - You can also start as a worshipper of a Demon God Malseraph.
 - To gain power, kill humans or angels. Beware of blessed ones. If you gain enough power you can be promoted.

-------------------- 
THE PRIMORDIAL

 - You start as a monstrous Eater of the dead who rose from thousands years of slumber to drive Angels and Demons away from the City.
 - Eat corpses to gain health and power. Spend power to gain beneficial mutations. 
 - To win, kill all angels and demons.

--------------------
CITIZENS OF THE CITY

 - Humans are generally weak and frail.
 - Citizens of the City will mostly try to flee whenever there is an enemy in sight.
 - But beware of the military that can arrive later in the battle.

--------------------
THE CHURCH

 - Priests start in the church and are able to gain followers, grant divine protection, smite demons from afar and slow them.
 - Priests share the goal with angels.

--------------------
THE MILITARY

 - The military is allied with the citizens of the City but opposes both angels and demons.
 - All military units are capable of ranged combat.
 - You may start as a Chaplain or as a Scout.
 - The Chaplain can lead troops, reveal disguised enemies and provide divine protection to allies.
 - The Scout starts with a horse. He is armed with a powerful rifle, can reveal disguised enemies and call for an artillery strike.

--------------------
THE CRIMINALS

 - The criminals (who are opposed to the citizens and the military, but will not attack the Angels) are kept mainly in the prison.
 - You may start as the Thief, who is found somewhere on the rooftops of the City.
 - The Thief's primary weapons are stealth and an ability to climb walls. Unlike all other characters, he is able to evade any conflict by hiding in the shadows or getting some place he can not be reached.
 - The Thief's goal is to get hold of enough gold and leave this accursed City.

--------------------
THE SATANISTS

 - The Satanists are those who opened the gates for the Hierarchy to enter. They are allied with Demons and thus are enemies of everyone else.
 - Satanists are able to curse to cause inaccuracy, summon demons and raise dead. You may start as one.
 - While the undead (which are technically demons possessing dead bodies) are generally weak, there is no shortage of material in the City to create an enormous army.
 - Satanists share the same goal with the Demons.

--------------------
THE LOST SOUL

 - You were the one who triggered the whole invasion. The satanists have sacrificed your body to open the gates to Hell, but your soul lingered in this world.
 - You start as a frail ghost that will be attacked by everybody. While in ghost form you can pass through walls and turn yourself invisible for a short time. 
 - You can also possess humans and dead bodies from a distance. Your possession ability is improved as compared to the demons because you retain all the traits and capabilities of your host as well as its faction alliances.
 - Your task is to find the Book of Rituals and recite certain passages from it while standing on the sacrificial circle, the place of your death, to find the final rest.
