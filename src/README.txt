
CITY OF THE DAMNED

--------------------
OVERVIEW

The year is 1915. The Great War thunders in the west, but the Hinterland is not safe either. The Legions of Hell invaded the City with the intention to slay its inhabitants. The Heavenly Forces had to intervene. Now both sides are bent to fight each other until none of the opponents remain. Choose your side and join the fray!

This is a simple fast-paced coffee-break roguelike inspired by a 7DRL entry "City of the Condemned" by Tapio (http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=City_of_the_Condemned).

GENERAL TIPS

 - The two primary sides are Angels and Demons. Though mankind is allied with the Angels, it is mainly stuck in the conflict between the parties.
 - You are not alone and should not be able to overcome all obstacles by yourself, some enemies will require aid from your allies.
 - Your enemies are able to hide their true appearance, so observe and learn their tactics to avoid nasty surprises.
 - You can attack your allies but not members of your own faction. This does not extend to demons - they can attack anyone.
 - Your resource is power. You can stockpile it to get a "level up" or spend it on your abilities.
 - You gain power proportional to the strength of killed enemies. Besides each party has other special ways to gain power.

--------------------
THE HEAVENLY FORCES

 - You start as an Angel who can easily dispatch lowly Imps.
 - Bless humans to gain power.
 - To win, kill all demons or ascend beyond Archangel. Survival of mankind is not required.
 
-------------------- 
THE LEGIONS OF HELL

 - You start as a puny Imp who is no match for an Angel.
 - Kill humans to gain power. Beware of blessed ones. 
 - To win, kill all angels or ascend beyond Archdemon. Destruction of mankind is not enough.

--------------------
CITIZENS OF THE CITY

 - Humans are generally weak and frail.
 - Citizens of the City will mostly try to flee whenever there is an enemy in sight.
 - But beware of the military that will arrive later in the battle.

--------------------
THE MILITARY

 - The military is allied with the citizens of the City but opposes both angels and demons.
 - All military units are capable of ranged combat.
 - You may start as a Chaplain or as a Scout.
 - The Chaplain can lead troops, reveal disguised enemies and provide divine protection to allies.
 - The Scout starts with a horse, can also reveal disguised enemies and is armed with a powerful rifle.
 - To win, kill all demons. But do not let angels stand in your way.

--------------------
THE CRIMINALS

 - The criminals (who are opposed to the citizens and the military, but will not attack the Angels) are kept mainly in the prison.
 - You may start as the Thief, who is found somewhere on the rooftops of the City.
 - The Thief's primary weapons are stealth and an ability to climb walls. Unlike all other characters, he is able to evade any conflict by hiding in the shadows or getting some place he can not be reached.
 - The Thief's goal is to get hold of enough gold and leave this accursed City.
 - But beware - the Thief is rather frail and is not immune to possession.
