GENERAL TIPS

 - You can side either with Angels or with Demons. Though mankind is allied with angels, it is mainly stuck in the conflict between the parties.
 - You are not alone and should not be able to overcome all obstacles by yourself, some enemies will require aid of your allies.
 - Your enemies are able to hide their true appearence, so observe and learn their tactics to avoid nasty surprises.
 - "Friendly fire" is allowed, so do not get in the way of your more powerfull allies.
 - Your resource is power. You can stockpile it to get a "level up" or spend it on your abilities.
 - You gain power proportional to the strength of killed enemies. Besides each party has other special ways to gain power.

--------------------
NOTE

 - The game is known to freeze sometimes for several seconds after you make a move, especially in the beginning. This is due to pathfinding calculations happening for more than 100 actors. Once their numbers naturally dwindle these delays become unnoticeable.

--------------------
TIPS FOR THE HEAVENLY FORCES

 - The Heavenly Forces are represented with two units: Angel and Archangel.
 - You start as an Angel who can easily dispatch lowly Imps. 
 - You can bless humans to gain power.
 - You are able to hide you divinity and disguise yourself as a human to lure enemies to you.
 - Your strength is an ability to heal yourself when needed.
 - To win, kill all demons or ascend beyond Archangel. Survival of mankind is not required.
 
-------------------- 
TIPS FOR THE LEGIONS OF HELL

 - The Legions of Hell are represented with three units: Imp, Demon and Archdemon.
 - You start as a puny Imp who is no match for an Angel. Run or summon help when confronted by one.
 - Imps and demons are able to possess humans. Once "in possession", you will appear as this human to everybody else. Archdemons no longer need this tactic of a coward and can not possess anybody.
 - You kill humans (or fellow demons, by the way) to gain power and heal.
 - Beware of blessed ones. When you touch them - you will burn and consume the blessing. Blessed humans are immune to possession. Though the damage from blessings is minor, it way prove fatal in some situations.
 - Your strength is an ability to summon allies to yourself to gang up on your enemy. 
 - To win, kill all angels or ascend beyond Archdemon. Destruction of mankind is not enough.
