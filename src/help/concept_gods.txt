MALSERAPH, THE DEMON GOD OF ACTING, GAMBLING AND VIOLENT CHANGES

Malseraph is one of three Demon Gods that rule the Pandemonium. It is the god of acting, gambling, and violent changes.
Malseraph likes:
 - when its followers disguise themselves or lose their disguise,
 - when its followers polymorph themselves or others,
 - when its followers generally find themselves in dangerous situations.
Malseraph dislikes boredom and its mood constantly deteriorates when nothing interesting happens.
Malseraph is the god of cards and will draw a card from its own deck to spice things up. When in the good mood, the card is likely to be beneficial to the follower. When the bad mood, the card will abuse the follower, much to Malseraph's joy.
When Malseraph finds the follower especially interesting, it can grant its own deck of cards to the follower. These decks may be decks of war to help in combat or decks of escape to find a way out of tight situations.
