THE PLOT
The year is 1915. The Great War thunders in the west, but the Hinterland is not safe either. The Pandemonium Hierarchy invaded the City with the intention to slay its inhabitants. The Celestial Communion had to intervene. Now both sides are bent to fight each other until none of the opponents remain.
Choose your side and join the fray!

GENERAL TIPS
 - You are not alone here - there are allies that can help.
 - Your enemies are able to hide their true appearance, so observe and learn their tactics to avoid nasty surprises.
 - You can attack your allies but not members of your own faction. This does not extend to demons - they can attack anyone.
 - Angels and Demons gain power when killing each other proportional to the strength of the slain adversary.
 - Stockpile power to get promoted or spend it on available abilities.
 
THE CELESTIAL COMMUNION
 - The Celestial Communion is represented with one unit: a Chrome Angel that can temporarily transform itself into an Avatar of Brilliance.
 - A Chrome Angel can easily dispatch lowly Imps. To deal with more powerful targets, invoke the Avatar of Brilliance powers. 
 - You can bless humans to gain power.
 - You are able to hide your divinity and disguise yourself as a human to lure enemies to you.
 - Your strength is the ability to heal yourself when needed. You are also able to see what all other Angels see.
 - To win, kill all demons or ascend beyond Chrome Angel. Survival of mankind is not required.
 
THE PANDEMONIUM HIERARCHY
 - The Pandemonium Hierarchy is represented with three units: an Imp, Demon, and Archdemon.
 - You start as a puny Imp who is no match for a Chrome Angel. Run or summon help when confronted by one.
 - Imps and Demons are able to possess humans. Once "in possession", you will appear as this human to everybody else. Archdemons no longer need this cowardly tactic and can not possess anybody.
 - You kill humans (or fellow demons, by the way) to gain power and heal.
 - Beware of blessed ones. When you touch them, you will burn and consume the blessing. Blessed humans are immune to possession. Though the damage from blessings is minor, it may prove fatal in some situations.
 - Your strength is the ability to summon allies to yourself to gang up on your enemy. 
 - Remember, "friendly fire" is allowed for your faction. Be cautious when walking side-by-side with your "friends".
 - To win, kill all angels or ascend beyond Archdemon. Destruction of mankind is not enough.

OUTSIDER BEASTS
 - Outsider beasts are half-sentient creatures of various origin that will actively attack everything in sight, including their own kin.
 - The demonic invasion has attracted Fiends. If a demon gets near one, it will be able to dominate and ride it as a mount.
 - The Gargantaur has descended from the celestial spheres. It is a huge (3x3) creature, which is able to burn enemies' minds, heal and teleport itself. The destruction of the Gargantaur is not required for the Demons to win. Angels may dominate these at the cost of their own health, but in return, they will be able to invoke Gargantaur's mind burn.
 - The wisps have been exposed to the celestial light for so long that they are completely blind. Yet they navigate using their hearing and are able to fly. Wisps will not attack each other and the Angels.
 
CITIZENS OF THE CITY
 - Humans are frail and weak. Citizens of the City will try to flee whenever they see an enemy.

THE CHURCH
 - Priests have an array of divine abilities. They are able to grant divine shield to allies, scorch and reveal true form of all enemies in sight, slow and smite enemies. The divine shield provides a one-time protection from any harm.
 - Whenever a priest gives humans a divine shield, they will start to follow the preacher.
 - Smiting damage increases with the number of humans the priest sees.
 - Priests can also give fire-based melee attacks to themselves and their followers by praying for wrath.
 - Priests start in the church.
 - Their goal is to destroy all demons. 
 
THE MILITARY 
 - The military arrives towards the end of the battle for the City. It is allied with the citizens but opposes both angels and demons. 
 - The military is comprised of five units: Soldiers, Scouts, Sergeants, Machine-gunners and Chaplains. All of them are capable of ranged combat but do not gain power whatsoever.
 - Soldiers are armed with single-shot rifles and need to reload every other turn.
 - Scouts have a more powerful rifle than soldiers, are able to reveal the true form of a single enemy and enter the battle riding a horse.
 - Sergeants wield six-round revolvers that deal less damage than a rifle but do not need to be reloaded so often.
 - Machine-gunners carry a light machine gun capable of firing the whole magazine in one turn. Alas, its accuracy leaves to be desired. 
 - Chaplains are also armed with six-round revolvers but, more importantly, are able to pray to reveal disguised enemies or to grant divine protection to allies (similar to priests). They can also issue a "Follow me" order to lead other troops across the battlefield.
 - If you side with the military, you may start as a Chaplain or as a Scout. 
 - Chaplains are accompanied by a host of loyal troops. 
 - Scouts start alone but compensate that with unsurpassed speed. Be careful, though - unlike a Chaplain, you do not have protection from possession. So if a demon traps you in your own body, the game is over for you.
 - To win, you need to kill all demons. Destruction of angels is unnecessary though sometimes inevitable.
 
THE CRIMINALS
 - The criminals (who are opposed to the citizens and the military, but will not attack the Communion) are kept mainly in the prison (except for the Thief).
 - You may start as the Thief, who is found somewhere on the rooftops of the City.
 - Though the Thief is armed with a knife, his primary weapons are stealth and an ability to climb walls. Unlike all other characters, he is able to evade any conflict by hiding in the shadows or getting some place he can not be reached.
 - Note that the citizens, the Communion units, and the military radiate light, while the Demons do not. 
 - As the Thief, you always start at night but a new day will come eventually that will severely hinder your ability to hide. 
 - To win, grab enough gold and get to the edge of the map to leave this accursed City.
 - But beware - the Thief is rather frail and is not immune to possession.
 
THE SATANISTS
 - Satanists are allied with demons. They are able to call demons to them for free, curse all enemies in sight with inaccuracy and raise dead.
 - While the undead (which are technically demons possessing dead bodies) are generally weak, there is no shortage of material in the City to create an enormous army.
 - You may play as a Satanist. But beware of the military - you will not be able to conceal the fact that you are an enemy of humankind.
 - To win, destroy the Communion.
